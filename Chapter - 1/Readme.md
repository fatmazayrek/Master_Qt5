## Chapter 1
Hi everyone :white_flower:

In this example, I did an application that you can add/remove the desired tasks :lock:

For this, there are two .ui file. Once of them is mainwindow.ui, the other one is task.ui :pick:

When you click the *Add Task* button, an InputDialog opens and ask you what the task name you will do :hammer_and_pick:

When you enter the task name then *Task Widget* is added on the MainWindow Widget :gear:

Each time you add/remove a task, the above label is updated :arrow_backward:

I hope it helps your studies :high_brightness:

*_Note_*: In this example I showed you how to use: _QInputDialog_, _Signal/Slots_, _using two widgets in the same project_ :white_check_mark:
