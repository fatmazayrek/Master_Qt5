Hi everyone

In this example, I did an application that you can add/remove the desired tasks. 

For this, there are two .ui file. Once of them is mainwindow.ui, the other one is task.ui

When you click the *Add Task* button, an InputDialog opens and ask you what the task name you will do

When you enter the task name then *Task Widget* is added on the MainWindow Widget

Each time you add/remove a task, the above label is updated

I hope it helps your studies

*_Note_*: In this example I showed you how to use: _QInputDialog_, _Signal/Slots_, _using two widgets in the same project_
